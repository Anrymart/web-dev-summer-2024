## Layouts

1. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp - this article explains
   how to build layouts using CSS float. This was the primary way before CSS
   flexbox and CSS grid layouts were introduced (before CSS float, people mostly
   used HTML table to build layouts).
2. https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ - CSS flexbox is a
   relatively simple, but very powerful tool. The flex layout allows responsive
   elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending upon
   screen size.
3. https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/ - CSS grid is a
   powerful tool for two-dimensional layouts.
